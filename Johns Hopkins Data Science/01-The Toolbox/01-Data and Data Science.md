# Introduction to Data Science

Data science is defined as using data to answer questions, and it is a broad field involving statistics, computer science, mathematics, data cleaning, formatting, and visualization. A data scientist combines software programming, statistics, and storytelling skills to extract valuable information from data.

> The rise of data science is attributed to the vast amount of available data, inexpensive computing, and the development of tools for data analysis.

## Data and Big Data

Data is defined as information, especially facts or numbers collected to be examined and used for decision-making. Data is also defined as a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables. Qualitative data describes qualities, while quantitative data describes quantities.

Data often comes in messy formats.Images and videos are also data sources that can be analyzed.

> A good data scientist asks questions first and seeks out relevant data second.

Big data is characterized by three qualities: volume (large datasets), velocity (rapid data generation), and variety (different types of data, structured and unstructured). Big Data often involves unstructured data from sources like emails, social media, and GPS tracking. Analyzing unstructured data poses challenges, but it can offer valuable insights.

Challenges of Big Data include storing and analyzing large volumes of data, dealing with constantly updating information, managing the variety of data sources, and working with messy, unstructured data.

Benefits of Big Data include identifying hidden correlations, providing real-time information, and answering questions that were previously inaccessible.

## Skills of a Data Scientist

A data scientist needs substantive expertise, hacking skills (computer programming), and math and statistics knowledge. Math, statistics, and hacking together solutions.

The ability to solve problems is essential for a data scientist. Reading manuals, searching online, and using forums, rubber duck debugging, which involves explaining the problem to a person or object are all ways that can help you solve a problem.

When seeking help, it's important to ask specific questions, include details of your troubleshooting, and follow forum etiquette. This includes being courteous and following up with solutions to your posted question.

## Project Process

The Data Science project process includes forming a question, finding data, analyzing the data, and communicating the results. An example of a data science project is provided where Hilary Parker analyzed baby name popularity data.
