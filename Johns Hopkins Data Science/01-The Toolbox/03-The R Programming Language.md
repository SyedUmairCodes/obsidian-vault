# Introduction to R

R is a programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical analysis and graphics. It is a popular language in data science, and it is free to use. R's extensive functionality is due to its large community of users that develop and share packages. R can be used for various tasks, such as making websites, maps, and analyzing language.

> RStudio is a graphical user interface (GUI) for R, and it provides a user-friendly environment for writing, editing, and storing code, as well as generating and viewing plots and managing files.

R packages are collections of functions, data, and code that extend the functionality of base R. Packages are developed and published by the R community and are available on repositories such as CRAN, Bioconductor, and GitHub. Once a package is installed, its functions must be loaded using the library() function. 

Projects are a way to organize work in R and keep all related files together. A project creates a folder that serves as the working directory, and it remembers which files were open when the project was closed, restoring the work environment.

R Markdown is a method for creating reproducible documents that combine text and code. R Markdown documents can be rendered into various formats, such as HTML, PDF, Word documents, and slides.
