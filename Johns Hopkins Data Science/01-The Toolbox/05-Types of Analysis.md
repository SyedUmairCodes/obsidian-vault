# Different Types of Data Analysis

- **Descriptive Analysis:** This type of analysis aims to summarize data using measures like mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation. It focuses on describing the sample without generalizing to a larger population.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** This involves examining data to find relationships between variables. It can reveal correlations but doesn't establish causation. It helps formulate hypotheses for further study.
- **Inferential Analysis:** This uses a sample of data to make inferences about a larger population. It involves statistical modeling and is dependent on a representative sample.
- **Predictive Analysis:** This uses current and historical data to predict future outcomes. While it can identify correlations, it doesn't imply causation. The accuracy depends on the variables measured and the model used.
- **Causal Analysis:** This aims to identify cause-and-effect relationships by manipulating variables. It is often done through randomized studies and is considered the gold standard in data analysis, though getting appropriate data is challenging.
- **Mechanistic Analysis:** This seeks to understand the exact changes in variables that lead to specific outcomes. It is most often applied in physical or engineering sciences, or biological sciences when the datasets are well-modeled by deterministic equations.
