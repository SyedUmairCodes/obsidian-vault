# The R Programming Language

R is a dialect of the S language, developed at Bell Labs in 1976 for statistical analysis. Initially implemented as FORTRAN libraries, S evolved through several versions, with version 3 (1988) being rewritten in C and incorporating statistical modeling. Version 4 (1998) is the basis of the S language used today.

>Bell Labs licensed S to StatSci (later Insightful), who created S-PLUS.  Insightful was acquired by TIBCO, which continues to develop S-PLUS. 

R, created in 1991 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, is an implementation of S. Licensed under the GNU General Public License in 1995, R is free software.  Key features of R include syntax and semantics similar to S, cross-platform compatibility, modular packages, sophisticated graphics, interactive use, a powerful programming language, and a vibrant user community. 

R's drawbacks include being based on older technology, functionality dependent on user contributions, memory limitations, and not being suitable for all situations. The R system includes a base system with core and recommended packages, along with thousands of user-contributed packages on CRAN and Bioconductor.  Several manuals and books are available for learning and using R.
