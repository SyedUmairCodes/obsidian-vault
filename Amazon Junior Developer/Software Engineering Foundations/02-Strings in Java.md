# Intro to Java
If you use a mobile phone, laptop computer, or browse the internet, you most likely rely on Java without even realizing it. In this video, you'll explore some of Java's foundational features and why it powers so many devices and apps used every day. First, let's talk about what Java is. Java is an in-demand and versatile programming language and computing platform that was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. In the simplest terms, Java is a set of instructions that tell computers what to do. Java uses object-oriented programming, or OOP. This means it organizes programs using blueprints called classes and creates objects from those blueprints. A class is like a blueprint for a car. It specifies the properties, like color and brand, and the actions, like start and stop, that all cars have in common. An object is like a specific car created from that blueprint. For example, the car standing in your driveway is an object of that specific car's class. You'll learn more about object-oriented programming, or OOP, later. Let's talk more about how Java is used all around you. The wonderful thing about Java is that it uses principles that enable developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code. This makes Java a powerful tool for building complex applications with clear, organized architecture. Whenever you stream a video, play an online game, or even just browse the web, there's a good chance Java is working in the background to make everything run smoothly. Java plays a huge role in the technology used every day. It powers and is embedded into billions of devices, including credit cards and SIM cards, mobile phones, TV sets, and computers. To put it into perspective, there are more Java-powered devices in use today than the over 8 billion people on planet Earth. However, Java isn't only used to run everyday devices like mobile phones and laptops. It also works behind the scenes on millions of powerful computers worldwide. These high-end computers store and process data for websites, apps, and numerous other digital services. And that's not all. Both small and large organizations use Java as a programming language to develop their own custom software and run various web applications and services. Now that you have a good picture of how widely Java is used, let's explore some of the features that make Java so popular and versatile. Java is robust, meaning it is designed to handle errors and manage runtime exceptions gracefully through its built-in exception handling and garbage collection mechanisms. Before a Java program runs, the code is checked for errors, allowing any mistakes to be fixed beforehand. If something goes wrong while the program is running, Java can catch and handle those errors, preventing the program from crashing. This makes Java great for creating reliable, stable, and secure software, enhancing both the developer and end-user experience. Java also comes with a rich standard library. This is like a huge toolbox filled with pre-written code that you can use to build your applications. Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can use these ready-made tools to handle common tasks, like working with data, connecting to the internet, or creating graphical user interfaces. This makes it much faster and easier to develop complex software. What's more, Java has a strong and active community. This community includes millions of developers, many of whom share their knowledge and help each other out. There are countless online forums, tutorials, and open-source projects where you can learn more about Java and get help with any issues you might encounter. This support network is one of the reasons Java has remained popular for so long. Java is used in many different fields. Let's explore some of the key areas where Java shines. Many large businesses use Java to build enterprise-level applications. These are systems that help companies manage their operations, like customer relationship management, also known as CRM, and systems for enterprise resource planning, or ERP systems. Java is a powerful tool for building websites and web applications. Technologies like Java Server Pages, or JSP, and Servlets allow developers to create dynamic, interactive web pages. Did you know if you have an Android phone, you've used Java? Because of its reliability and performance, most Android apps are built using Java. Java is also used to create desktop applications, like media players, games, and productivity tools. Great examples are programs like Minecraft and Eclipse, which are written in Java. In summary, Java is a versatile and powerful programming language that plays a vital role in the tech world. Its robust features, rich standard library, and strong community support make it a top choice for developers. Whether you want to build enterprise solutions, websites, mobile or desktop applications, Java can open up a world of possibilities. 


Have you ever organized different types of food in your kitchen by placing them in separate jars? If you're fancy, you might even have descriptive labels like flour or corn flour to help you distinguish the contents of the container. Similarly, in any program you develop, you'll use different types of data, and to organize these data types, you'll use something called variables. In this video, you'll learn how to use variables to store various types of data, making it simpler to use your data when coding in Java. Let's start with the basics. What are variables? In programming, variables are like containers that hold different types of information. Think of them as label jars where you can store and retrieve data whenever you need it. Just like you might have a jar labeled cookies in your kitchen, in a program, you might have a variable labeled player score to keep track of points in a game. Use the keyword int on screen. It's one of the many data types in Java, and it is used for whole numbers. But more on this later. Let's first discuss two key terms, declaring and initializing variables. Declaring a variable means creating it with a given name or label and assigning it a data type, which defines the kind of data it will contain. You first type the data type, and then the title of the variables as int play score, and a semicolumn. In this case, play score is a container that can only carry whole numbers. When you assign a value to a variable, it is also known as initializing the variable. After you've declared the variable, you can give it a value. You simply type the name of the variable, equal sign, and the value followed by a semicolon. Now, here is the great thing. Java allows one to declare and initialize variables in one step. To do this, type int, player score, equal sign 150, followed by a semicolon. This code creates the variable and assigns a value to it at the same time. Just like neat containers in your kitchen cupboard, variables make coding better in many ways. Firstly, variables are reusable. Instead of typing the same value over and over, you can store it in a variable and use the variable name wherever you need it. This makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain. Second, variables are flexible. Variables can change their values as your program runs, allowing your code to react to different inputs and conditions. Finally, variables make code clear and easy to read. Using descriptive names for your variables helps make your code easier to read and understand. For example, notice how using player score is much clearer than just using the letter x. So far, you've learned about the int data type used for storing whole numbers, but there are many others. Let's explore some of them now. First up is a double data type for storing decimal numbers. For example, let's name this variable as currency in USD and assign it a value of 34.25. Another important one is the char data type to store single characters. For example, if a user needs to complete A, B, C, or D on a form. Let's create a char variable and name it as ampersand. Notice that the value of a char data type must be between two single quotation marks. Then there's the string data type to store short or long sentences or a name like Margaret Hamilton. Now, for string values, you have to place the value between double quotation marks. Finally, you use the Boolean data type to store a value that is either true or false. Let's call this Boolean variable e absent and assign it a value of true. When naming or labeling your variables, it's important to follow certain conventions to make your code more readable and maintainable. Let's explore a few of these. First, choose names that clearly describe the purpose of the variable. For example, use distance in meters instead of just D, and it's game over instead of flag. Next, use camel case for variable names. This means starting the first word in lower case and capitalizing the first letter of each subsequent word. For example, total amount, user name, and number of items. The first part of the name like total should start with a lower case and the second part like amount starts with an uppercase. Then, only use letters, numbers, and underscores in your variable names, but the names should not start with a number or contain spaces or special characters. For example, user age and max_value are valid variable names, while second place and max percentage sine value are not. Finally, Java is case sensitive, which means that total amount, where total starts with a lower case, and amount with an uppercase are considered as a different variable than total amount, where total and amount starts with capital letters. In this video, you've learned how to use variables to store various data types in Java. Here are some key points to take away. Variables are like labeled containers that hold specific data types and can be accessed whenever needed. Variables make data easy to reuse, provide flexibility, and help make your code clear and easy to read. In Java, the common data type includes int, char, double, string, and Boolean. Remember, declaring a variable involves creating it with a specific data type and initializing means assigning it a value. Finally, using proper naming conventions ensures that your variables are readable and maintainable. Just like organizing different types of food in your kitchen jars, using variables helps you manage various types of data efficiently in your programs.


Think about your favorite computer game. What makes it so fun and competitive? It likely features a leaderboard that ranks players by their scores, right. Players with the highest scores might even qualify for the next level based on specific criteria. If you had to program this feature, how would you go about it? Well, you will need a way to add a player's scores and you will want to compare the scores of different players to determine who has the highest score. Then you will also need a way to determine if players qualify for the next level based on more than one condition. By now, your programming brain is probably imagining the kind of variables to store these values, how to name them and so on. But how do you perform operations like adding and comparing values or making decisions based on certain conditions? You need operators and this is exactly what this video is about. There are several types of operators in Java, but this video focuses on three main arithmetic, relational and logical operators. Let's explore some simple examples to understand the problems each of these operators helps to solve. First up is arithmetic operators. You use these to perform basic math operations like addition and subtraction. Think of them as the tools you use to solve maths problems in Java. However, you can also use the addition operator with strings. This will combine the strings, which is referred to as concatenation in programming. Lets explore an example. If you use the addition operator with strings like Tom and Harry, this will result into Tom Harry combined as one word. But if you use the addition operator with two int like five seven, this will result in the sum of the two numbers twelve. Now this is where you need to take extreme care. Say you use the addition operator as five seven, but both values are written as string values inside double quotes. This will result in the string five seven and not twelve. So because the values are strings, they get concatenated with the addition operator. The addition operator can also be used in a print line to add the values of different data variables as a single combined output. Let's go over a simple example. The variable called player one level one stores the value 50 and the variable player one level two stores the value 45. The addition of these two variables will result in an output of 95. Observe that there is an addition sign in the print line and it concatenates two elements, the word sum, a string, and the actual output of this variable named sum. Now consider another example where you subtract values. Say player1Score stores the value 95, and player1Penalties stores the value 7. The subtraction of player one penalties from player one score results in the output of 88. Next you need to know about relational or comparative operators. These operators are used to compare two values. They can solve problems like is this number greater than that number? Lets first go over an example of the greater than relational operator that compares values to determine which is larger. Consider the variables player1Score and player2Score which store values 95 and 85 respectively. Now lets play with them. We can compare these two variables using the greater than operator and get either a true or a false. Lets test what happens. player1Score > player2Score results in true, coo,l right? Lets try another one. This time lets compare the values using the less than operator. Since the values are the same, the output player1Score < player2Score will result in false, right? Okay let's move on to the last type, logical operators. They are AND written with two ampersands in Java or typed as two pipe characters, and NOT, signified by an exclamation mark. You use these to combine multiple conditions. They help you make decisions based on more than one condition. Imagine there are three players and you need to check who has the highest score. In other words, the first condition is to check if player one's score is higher than player two's. Then you need to check if player one's score is higher than player three's. Logical operators are perfect for that, so lets test them out. But listen carefully, here is the tricky part. The AND operator will always result in either true or false. The result will only be true if the expression on the left and right sides of the AND operator are both true. In any other case the and operator will result in false. So here, three variables are declared, initialized and assigned values. Player one score is 95, player two score is 85 and player three score is 73. Now lets add a print line statement that prints the results of both expressions using the and operator. player1Score > player2Score && player1Score > player3Score and the result is true. Just like the and operator, the or operator's result will always be either true or false. And it will also be true if both expressions on its left and right are true. But here is the difference. Even if only one is true and the other is false, the result will still be true and it will result in false only if the expression on both sides of the or operator is false. Got it? Lets go over another example. This code checks if a user has access to the games premium feature which is only available to admins and those with premium membership. You can use the logical or operator to find out if a player either has admin rights or if he has a premium membership. The output will print true if one of the expressions is true and the other false if both are false, it will print false. Very useful, don't you think? Let's test out one more example. The not operator. The not operator inverts the value, so true becomes false and false becomes true. Let's test how it works. Consider the variable is authenticated and it is initialized to true. So here the print line inverses the value of the variable isAuthenticated to false. So !isAuthenticated will result in false. In this video, you have learned about three main types of operators in Java. Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Like adding a player's scores from multiple levels. You also covered relational operators that compare two values, determining if one is greater, less, or equal to another. Think leaderboard and lastly, you discovered how to use logical operators. These combine multiple conditions, using and or and not. For example, to determine if a player's score is higher than the scores of two other players.

These operators are essential tools in programming, and learning how to use them will allow you to perform a variety of tasks efficiently and effectively. Keep practicing and soon you'll be creating features like leaderboards with ease.
