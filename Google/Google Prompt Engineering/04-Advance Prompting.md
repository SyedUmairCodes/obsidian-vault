# Advance Prompting

Prompt chaining is a technique that involves using a series of interconnected prompts to guide a gen AI tool through complex tasks, with each prompt building upon the previous one. It is a deliberate process, similar to assembling a jigsaw puzzle, where you start with a game plan, and each step adds new layers of context.

Prompt chaining differs from iteration in that it uses the output of one prompt as a starting point for the next prompt, whereas iteration focuses on adjusting a given prompt to improve the results.

Chain of Thought (COT) Prompting is a method within prompt chaining where the gen AI tool is asked to explain its reasoning process step by step. This helps you understand how the tool arrives at a specific result, which is particularly helpful when making decisions based on the outputs.

Tree of Thought (TOT) Prompting involves asking the tool to explore multiple reasoning paths at once, similar to a maze where several paths may be tried before reaching the end. This is useful for solving abstract problems, such as plot development.

> Prompt chaining is particularly useful for exploring complex ideas and generating insightful responses that you might miss with a single prompt.

## Meta-Prompting

Meta-prompting involves using a gen AI tool to help you design better prompts. It can be used when you are unsure how to phrase a prompt, and it's sometimes referred to as "automatic prompt engineering". Meta-prompting is guided by best practices, or power-up strategies, that fall into two main categories:

- Direct generation: Ask the gen AI tool to generate a prompt for you.
- Template request: Ask the gen AI tool for an outline or structure to organize your prompts.
- Image: Use an image to shape or generate a prompt.
- Text: Use text as a reference to generate or shape a prompt.
- Meta-prompt chaining: Break the process of drafting a prompt into a series of sub-prompts.

## Prompt refinement strategies

- Leveling up: Ask the gen AI tool to elevate your prompting.
- Remixing: Ask the gen AI tool to combine multiple prompts into a single "super-prompt".
- Style swap: Ask the gen AI tool to rewrite your prompt with a different mood or tone.
- Meta-prompting can help you design the perfect prompt, or take an existing prompt to the next level. Meta-prompting is a roadmap for getting the best possible output from a gen AI tool.

## AI Agents
AI agents are specialized versions of a gen AI tool that can be used for different purposes, such as a coding partner or a creative soundboard. They can transform your gen AI tool into your own team of experts.

AgentSim helps you simulate scenarios, such as interviews or difficult conversations.
To create an effective AgentSim, you need to provide a lot of detail and background information about the persona, specify the types of conversations you want it to have, and use a stop phrase to indicate when and how the role play can end.

AgentSim can be used to practice skills, such as articulating strengths, communicating professionally and confidently, and discussing future career goals.

AgentX provides expert feedback on any topic you prompt it to be an expert in. This type of agent is useful when you need a personalized consultant to give you feedback on your work. You can set up an interactive conversation, specify a stop rule, and have the agent give you a summary of the conversation, highlighting areas for improvement.

You can create customized versions of Gemini called GEMS, where you simply describe what you want your GEM to do and how you want it to respond, and Gemini will take those instructions to create it.
