# Writing Great Prompts

Interacting with AI using prompts is a new form of communication, where the AI "listens" and responds in a way that is shaped by the user's input.

## The Prompting Framework
Google's AI team has created a framework for writing better prompts, when followed allows you to get the best response from AI systems.

- Make the AI adopt the persona you need and give it a task.
- Give all the context you can about your task.
- If you can add examples or references, please do.
- Evaluate the output and if it doesn't suit your needs keep on iterating.

> Iteration is a key part of effective prompting, and it often involves adding more information, tweaking the phrasing of the prompt, or using different methods.

Break Down Long Prompts, separate long prompts into shorter, more specific sentences. Rephrasing your prompt or using a similar but different task can trigger a new and more useful response from the AI. Add limitations or constraints to narrow down the AI's outputs. This can help you get more unique or specific results.
## Multimodal Prompts
This involves using different types of media in the prompt, such as text, images, audio, or code. Using an image and text to generate a social media caption, using images of logos as references to create more logo choices, or using a picture of a chart to explain its data.

Multimodal prompting can enhance problem-solving and save time by making connections between different types of information.
