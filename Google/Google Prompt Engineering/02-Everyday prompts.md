# Everyday prompts

Prompting is a new way to interact with computers, using natural language to communicate with AI, and it's becoming increasingly important as AI becomes a common part of daily life. The core of effective prompting lies in a framework involving task, context, evaluation, and iteration.

- Task: Define what you want the AI to do, including the desired persona and format.
- Persona: Specify the expertise or role you want the AI to assume (e.g., "a professional speech writer" or "a marketing executive") or the audience you want the output to be geared towards.
- Format: Determine how you want the output to appear, such as a list, short sentences, or a table.

Provide necessary details to help the AI understand what you need, adding specifics to a request. For instance, instead of asking for "ideas for a birthday present," specify the budget, the recipient's age, and interests.
## Types of Prompting
Give the AI examples to work from. This can include tone, style, or length. Providing multiple references is known as "few-shot prompting".

- Few-shot prompting uses several references.
- Single-shot prompting uses one reference.
- Zero-shot prompting does not use any references.

Assess whether the output meets your needs. Refine your prompt based on your evaluation. Add more information or tweak your prompt to get better results. This is a key part of effective prompting. This iterative process should be thought of as an ongoing conversation.

Add limitations or parameters to focus the AI's output. For example, when requesting a playlist, specify that you only want music from a certain region or time period.

## Multimodal Prompts
AI tools can use different modalities (text, images, video, audio, or code). Multimodal prompting involves using different types of media as input, such as images and text together. This can be helpful when you want to extract information from images or other media.

- You can upload an image of a chart and ask the AI to explain the data.
- You can input a picture of nail art and ask for a social media caption.
- You can upload a conference schedule and ask the AI to extract specific events.
