# AI-powered Tools

AI tools are AI-powered software that can automate or assist users with a variety of tasks. An AI model is a computer program trained on data to recognize patterns and perform tasks.

AI tools are like cars with user-friendly interfaces that help you get to your destination. AI models are like the engine under the hood that processes information and allows the tool to function. AI tools are developed for a wide range of applications, similar to how different types of cars are developed for different purposes.

AI tools can be stand-alone tools, integrated features, or custom solutions. Stand-alone AI tools are AI-powered software designed to be used on their own, often accessed online or downloaded to a device. An example is Speeko, an AI speech coach that analyzes voice and gives feedback on communication skills.

Integrated AI features are built-in enhancements to existing software. An example is Neural Filters in Adobe Photoshop, which lets users edit images. Custom AI solutions are applications tailored to solve a specific problem. An example is an AI solution implemented at Johns Hopkins Hospital that helps doctors detect sepsis.

AI models are developed through a process called training. The typical steps for training an AI model include:

- Defining the problem to be solved.
- Collecting relevant data to train the model.
- Preparing the data for training by labeling important features and separating the data into a training set and a validation set.
- Applying machine learning (ML) programs to the prepared training data.
- Evaluating the model using the validation set.
- Deploying the model once satisfied with its performance.

> Model training is an iterative process where each step can be repeated and adjusted as needed. Once deployed, models are continuously monitored and refined.
