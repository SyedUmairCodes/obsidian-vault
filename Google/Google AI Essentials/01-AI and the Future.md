# Adopting AI

Like how knowing the roads and stops makes you a better driver, knowing AI will make you a smarter and more efficient person in the modern world as it helps you perform repeating and cognitive tasks easily by extending our cognitive abilities and helps us in making better decisions. AI is becoming an industry standard that companies are adopting at a fast pace so learning how to effectively use AI in your day-to-day activities is a must for every one.

AI is changing how industries and business activities. Companies are using AI to develop innovative solutions to a variety of workplace tasks and challenges, integrating AI helps employees analyze information more effectively, allowing them to get answers to work-related questions more quickly. Managers can use AI-powered analytics to make more informed business decisions by analyzing user interactions.

In the agricultural sector, AI is being used to address the challenges faced by rural farmers. Farmers often experience economic uncertainty due to fluctuating crop yields, weather conditions, and limited access to advanced techniques. Companies like Jiva are providing AI solutions to help farmers achieve sustainable and reliable farming practices.

AI tools can diagnose crop diseases and recommend appropriate remedies. Farmers can receive AI-powered advice to help them produce better quality crops and increase their yields. AI provides farmers with access to insights that can improve their business operations.

## AI and ML

While AI has been around for a while, machine learning is what powers the AI tools used in many applications. Streaming platforms use AI tools to offer recommendation systems that enhance the user experience.

AI tools are AI-powered software that can automate or assist users with a variety of tasks including GPS systems that suggest quick routes and translation systems that interpret conversations in real-time. Companies use AI tools to streamline operations and improve the quality of their products and services.

Machine Learning is a specialized layer within AI focused on developing computer programs that analyze data to make decisions or predictions. ML is often used by AI tools to make sense of data quickly and efficiently.

AI designers build ML programs using a training set, which is a collection of data used to teach the AI. The training set provides the ML program with examples of what to expect and how to respond appropriately.

Computer vision and ML can be used to pick the highest quality of produce from a farm if the ML model is trained on images of produce like apples and potatoes. The effectiveness of ML programs depends on the quality and relevance of the training data. Bias in training data can lead to inaccurate outputs, if the apple-sorting AI tool is trained only on red apples, it may not accurately identify ripe apples of other colors.
