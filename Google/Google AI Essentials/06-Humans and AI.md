# Humans and AI

Human-in-the-loop is an approach that uses a combination of machine and human intelligence to train, use, verify, and refine AI models. This approach is essential to ensure quality and accuracy when using AI. It is a way to refine the AI's answers, and is crucial when practicing responsible AI.

Responsible AI is the principle of developing and using AI ethically with the intent of benefiting people and society while avoiding harm. Here are some of the limitations of AI tools:

- Knowledge cutoff is the concept that an AI model is trained at a specific point in time so it doesn't have knowledge of events or information after that date.
- Hallucinations are AI outputs that are not true, and can lead to misinformation.

AI tools are not always appropriate for every task. For example, tasks that require communication and relationship building would not be suitable for generative AI tools.

- Is the task generative?
- Can the task be iterated on to achieve the best outcome?
- Are there resources to provide adequate human oversight?
