# Using AI for Good

Google's SOS alerts are used in nine countries to detect and provide geographic alerts about wildfires. AI algorithms analyze data to anticipate fire behavior, which aids in forest fire response and helps in evacuating people from dangerous areas.

DeepMind, another organization, developed a machine learning system to predict how proteins fold, which could lead to breakthroughs in treating various genetic diseases. It's not necessary to understand the technical details of how AI works, similar to how people use cars without knowing how they're constructed. Instead, it is important for people to understand both the capabilities and risks of AI.

As AI technology improves, it will significantly impact all aspects of life, including enhancing research, education through personal tutors for every student, and creative processes by providing new tools for artists. Just as the internet became a platform for creativity and innovation, the AI world is anticipated to have a similar transformative effect.

## Collaborating with AI

AI can help with various tasks, both simple and complex, allowing users to complete tasks more quickly and efficiently. AI can help to start documents by creating templates, sections, and headings. It can help automating tasks like filtering spam emails while the users focus on more complex tasks.

Successful businesses should prioritize a people-first approach to AI, where AI enhances human skills and simplifies work tasks. This involves striking a balance between augmentation and automation. Integrating AI at work requires collaboration across different roles and departments. Diverse perspectives are critical to ensuring that the AI tools' output meets expectations and is beneficial for the entire organization.

As AI is introduced into the workplace, it's important to learn and adapt to the changes. Understanding AI and its potential benefits will allow for more effective contributions to discussions about integrating AI into workflows.

## Limitations

Despite its capabilities, AI has limitations and requires human oversight. AI cannot learn independently and needs continuous updates to its training data. Shortcomings in training data can lead to biased or unfair outcomes. Furthermore, AI output can contain inaccuracies, known as hallucinations, which can range from minor errors to significant distortions.

Due to the limitations of AI, human oversight is crucial to ensure the information is accurate and ethical. The management of AI in the workplace requires teamwork to align AI's output with values that benefit people. An inclusive approach that maintains human oversight is necessary to ensure that AI works for everyone.
