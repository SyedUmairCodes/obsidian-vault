# AI and ML

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are changing the future of work. While both terms seem similar, machine learning is actually a specific technique used by AI designers to achieve artificially intelligent computer programs.

## AI Development

**Artificial intelligence** refers to computer programs that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. There are two main techniques used to design AI programs:

- **Rule-based techniques** involve creating AI programs that strictly follow predefined rules to make decisions. For example, a spam filter using rule-based techniques might block emails that contain specific keywords using its predefined logic.
- **Machine learning techniques** involve creating AI programs that can analyze and learn from patterns in data to make independent decisions. A spam filter using these techniques might flag potential spam for the recipient to review, preventing automatic blocking. If the recipient marks emails from trusted sources as safe, the spam filter learns and adapts its logic to include similar emails from that sender in the future.

AI tools can use either rule-based or ML techniques, or even a combination of both. In general, rule-based techniques are commonly used for tasks that require rigidity, such as blocking messages from un-trusted senders that are obviously spam, like requests for bank transfers or private information.

Conversely, ML techniques are better suited for tasks demanding flexibility and adaptability, like learning to recognize that messages from trusted senders containing typos are not spam.
## Types of ML

**Supervised learning**
In this approach, the ML program learns from a _labeled_ training set. A labeled training set includes data that is labeled or tagged, which provides context and meaning to the data. 

**Unsupervised learning**
In this approach, the ML program learns from an _unlabeled_ training set. An unlabeled training set includes data that does not have labels or tags.

**Reinforcement learning**
In this approach, the ML program uses trial-and-error to learn which actions lead to the best outcome. The program learns to do this by getting rewarded for making good choices that lead to the desired results. Reinforcement learning is commonly used by conversational AI tools. As these tools receive feedback from users and AI designers, they learn to generate effective responses.
