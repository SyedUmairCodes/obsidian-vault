# Gemini for Security Engineer

Security engineers face a constant influx of information about new threats and vulnerabilities. Analyzing this data, correlating it with their own infrastructure logs, and determining appropriate action is complex and time-consuming.

Traditional security tools often present overwhelming amounts of raw data, requiring specialized knowledge (like UDM syntax) to navigate.

## How Gemini Helps Security Engineers

- Gemini gathers threat data from various sources (like Mandiant) into a centralized location.
- Gemini uses AI to provide concise summaries of threat actor profiles, attack patterns, and security events, making large volumes of data digestible.
- Gemini enables natural language queries within security logs (Chronicle). The engineer can ask questions in plain English instead of needing to construct complex search queries using specialized syntax.
- When threats are detected, Gemini helps the engineer understand the necessary corrective actions by summarizing findings and providing guidance within the Security Command Center.
