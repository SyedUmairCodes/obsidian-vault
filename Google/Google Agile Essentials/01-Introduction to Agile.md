# Introduction to Agile

Agile refers to the ability to move quickly and easily. In the professional world, it's an iterative approach to project management that enables quick movement and adaptability to change. Agile emerged in the 1990s with the booming software industry when software startups and tech giants sought faster ways to build software.

Agile allows projects repeat processes multiple times during the life-cycle. Work is done in shorter blocks of time, called iterations and they can be repeated based on feedback.
