# Google Vertex AI Studio

Vertex AI Studio is available in Google cloud for users to run the latest Gemini models in their own apps and services. Vertex AI Studio allows you to use Gemini in two modes. The regular chat interface and the freeform mode. In Freeform mode, you can design prompts for various tasks such as classification, extraction, and generation. There is no conversation history in Freeform mode, so every prompt is a brand-new request to the model.

You can select the model of Gemini that you want to use for your prompt and also set the temperature as well as provide examples and upload files directly to Vertex AI Studio or use the files available in your cloud storage buckets.

You can also use multi-modality for your prompts in Vertex AI Studio and save them in the prompt gallery for later use and also look at other example prompts.
