# Introduction to Gemini 1.5 Pro Models

Gemini 1.5 Pro is a new language model from the Gemini family. This model introduces a breakthrough long context window of up to 1 million tokens that can help seamlessly analyze large amounts of information and long-context understanding. It can process text, images, audio, video, and code all together for deeper insights.

Gemini 1.5 pro can undestand long-form audio content and provide transcriptions by transcribing the text and providing summaries as well as adding information about the different speakers in the audio to the summary.
It can also create chapter-wise summaries as well. (This is something I tried personally.)

Gemini 1.5 pro can also summarize video content as well and pick up important words or frames that are part of the video. It can also easily summarize PDF files including whole books thanks to the large token window.

Gemini 1.5 Pro is natively multimodal and supports interleaving of data from different modalities, it can support a mix of audio, visual, text, and code inputs in the same input sequence.
