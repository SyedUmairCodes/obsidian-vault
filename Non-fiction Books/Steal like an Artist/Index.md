# Steal like an Artist

If you are a creative person, some of your ideas have been copies of someone else's work and vice versa. Creative people not only copy others work but also improve it by adding their own touch to it.

> When people call something original it means that they don't know the reference or original sources involved in the making. -- Jonathan Lethem.

Most products you see are the exact copies of their rivals, only the branding has changed. In regards to this, this quote fits perfectly.

> Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again. -- André Gide:

A single idea is a mix of multiple different ideas and sources just like how human genetics work. You can't choose your genes but you can choose your teachers and the things that inspire you.

Creative people like to collect things that inspire them, there's a fine line between collecting and hoarding, make sure you're not a hoarder. You’re only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself. Your job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by.

If you like the work of another creative person and their work resonates with you then you should show appreciation by learning more about them and finding out what makes them tick.

The great thing about dead or remote masters is that they can’t refuse you as an apprentice. You can learn whatever you want from them. They left their lesson plans in their work.
