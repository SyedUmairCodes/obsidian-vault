# What is Dopamine
Dopamine is a chemical inside your brain that is released when you feel happy. Its basically a neurotransmitter which makes us anticipate rewards. It allows us to feel better and give a sense of accomplishment whenever we do something that makes us feel good.

But in reality, dopamine is not a pleasure chemical that everyone claims it to be because as soon as the reward is and dopamine is released then immediately after that everything becomes dull and empty again. Its kind of like a drug, the more you get it the more you will feel the desire to get it. No amount of simulation will be enough to make you feel fulfilled with your life and even after that most people are over simulated.

If you get addicted to dopamine, you’ll keep doing the tasks that simulate you and keep delaying the tasks the are important and your life will become a constant loop of dopamine hits. Your focus is a scarce asset, which is why marketers spend billions of dollars to attract your attention, mobile apps are designed to hook you, social media companies like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram know that the more time you spend on their platforms, the more money they make through advertising.

The suggestion algorithms have its pros and cons as well. It becomes easier for us to find the content that we want see but it becomes hard to stop watching since its the things that we are most attracted to.

You’re not the one using the internet, the internet is the one using you, In the modern day due to the overload of information around us it is very simple that anyone can hijack your dopamine levels and keep you hooked on to the things that they want you to be.

Posted a picture on social media, keep checking for the total number of likes and comments it gets, watching a video on YouTube, it will keep auto-playing similar videos, uploaded your online blog? you’ll keep checking your website traffic and other stats. Whenever you start to lose focus and divert your attention towards social media or any other online service that’s when they hijack your mind to lure you in.

Sweet foods and drinks release dopamine and give us a sensation of relaxation. In older times finding food that could be consumed easily was the biggest reward for a man and eating that food released enough dopamine that he could be enjoy it.In our times, food has become so easy to find that the reward part has been taken out of it but the food companies made sure that we keep on craving sugary and sweet foods and drinks so that after eating that dopamine could be released.

Dopamine addiction can have major negative impacts on the cognitive abilities of a person, studies have shown that long-term thinking can make a person make the right decisions about his life, future, and financial benefits. But, all of the external forces that are present in the modern-day world are the main problem that can cause you to fall for short-term thinking and instant gratification.
