# Keep Going
Creativity is not a linear process, sometimes you have to look back, sometimes we have to start again from scratch. Our lives are full of ups and downs but being creative in the midst of chaos can only be possible if you have and follow a daily routine. A daily routine will keep you occupied and make you enjoy your time.

Sometimes you won’t be able to follow your daily routine and will need to do things that you never planned on doing. But the important thing to remember is that you finished some tasks and not all.

If you enjoy your hobbies then most people will tell you to start a small business. This Is a very critical decision that you’ll have to make because turning a hobby into a business doesn’t always work out well. If you really want to make money through your hobbies you can sell limited amounts. Don’t live your life through online metrics, the number of likes and followers do matter but it shouldn’t be the only thing you are obsessed with.

You need to enjoy the work you do each day. If you don’t then just change your process of doing that. Learn to accept change for the better. Shake up things every once in a while. Wake up each day with a goal and work towards completing that goal. You’ll see that people put a lot of effort on their titles and not much in their work. Forget your title, just immerse yourself in work. Let your work define you.

Your attention is one of the most important things. In today’s world everyone wants to steal that from you. There are so many things in this world that constantly need our attention. Learn to give it to the things the matter the most to you.

If there is just too much chaos going around you turn on your airplane mode and disconnect from the world. Focus on your work and when you’re done, simply turn off the airplane mode. 

There is only a small number of things that you can focus on at a time so you need to figure out what is most important and what are the things that you should say no to. There is also a thing as paying too much attention and missing the tiny details that you are looking for.

Take your time with your craft, creativity takes time, slow down and enjoy the process. People obsess over the future but you should also revisit the past every now and then to keep your progress in check.
