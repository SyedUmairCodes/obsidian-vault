# Introduction
The amount of information that our brains receive and process throughout each day is just too much. We spend countless hours on consuming information but never focus on retaining that info for later. A second brain allows you to store virtually anything that you want and create relationships between different pieces of data that you have stored.

The second brain is a place to store all of the information that we receive and reuse it when we need it. In the modern age, everyone needs two brains, one for processing information and one for storing all that processed information.

## Capture Information
The CODE method is a simple way to save, refine, and reuse the information from
your second brain. There are four steps in the CODE method:

- Save the information that resonates with you - Capture
- Organize that information for easier access - Organize
- Extract the core concepts from the information that you need - Distill
- Apply the new knowledge you gained or share it with others - Express

## Organize Information
The PARA system consists of four parts which you can use to organize your
second brain effectively.

- Projects: Short term goals or tasks that you are working on.
- Areas: Long term goals that you want to manage overtime.
- Resources: Links, or other things that help you in your work.
- Archives: Inactive projects or the projects that have been completed.

You can use the PARA system to organize all the information you find to store in your second brain like:

- Highlights from your readings
- Ideas or materials you had but couldn’t apply them.
- Re-usable parts from previous projects.
- Links to resources or assets

Richard Feynman, one of the greatest minds of all time invented a system which he called his twelve favorite problems. He would keep at keep thinking about at least twelve different problems in his mind at all times. When he found something new, he would apply that to all twelve problems so that he could make some progress in at least one of the problems.

Software engineers, Product managers, Architects, and almost all professionals use the divide and conquer strategy to solve their problems, dividing a bigger problem into smaller ones is a great approach to easily solve problems.
## Converge and Diverge
When you close all connections with the outside world and only focus on the work you are doing then you are in the convergence mode. In divergence mode, you open your horizons and try to gather as much information about the topic you are looking for and collect a bundle of information.

Ernest Hemingway created a process for his writing called the Hemingway bridge, this process implies that you don’t stop working until you can define the next part of the project for your future self. This way you don’t get off track and don’t spend any time figuring out what you did yesterday and where should you continue from today.

Culinary chefs have a particular system for running their restaurants called Miss- en-place. They place all of their required ingredients in order of what goes first as placeholders so that they can easily grab what is needed and it acts as an extension for their brains.
