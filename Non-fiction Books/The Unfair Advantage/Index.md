# The Unfair Advantage

An unfair advantage is something that puts you ahead of your competition, each person has their own unique unfair advantages. You can develop more than one unfair advantage or combine yours with your friends, the unfair advantage of your friends can complement yours so that you both can leverage each other’s best abilities.

In this world, nothing will be a fair game. Sometimes you’ll win, sometimes lose. But the most important part is keeping a positive mindset, thinking greatly affects your ability to work, always have a mindset that is ready to learn.

## The MILES Framework
The authors developed a system called the MILES framework that can help anyone find and refine their own unfair advantages.

- Money: Having money to spend on resources or education puts you ahead of others.
- Intelligence: Having knowledge of things and the ability to learn new things quickly or information about a particular topic puts you at an advantage.
- Luck: Being at the right place at the right time can be a huge advantage in your favor.
- Education: Having knowledge and the ability to learn puts you at an advantage.
- Status: The better the status the more better people treat you and are willing to do favors for you.
## Creating a Startup
Before you create a startup you need to first answer the question, why are you creating this? Each person will have their own answer to this question. You also need to figure out what type of company you’ll build. A lifestyle company or a digital product or service.

Investors are excited only in products that can disrupt an industry or are capable of doing that, plan your idea correctly. Not every idea can be turned into a startup, if it’s a totally new concept you’ll have to educate people on how to use your product and if its an immediate success, chances are that a bigger company might offer to buy your product.

>You can’t create and manage your company alone, find someone that wants to work with you and create a team so that you don’t have to burden everything on your shoulders.

Conflicts can happen between founders and can cause negative effects on the company. When raising funds for your company keep the introduction short and simple and if you can then show the investors an MVP of your company.
