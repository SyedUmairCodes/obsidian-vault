# VUCA

VUCA is acronym for Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity. Developed by the US Military War College to address changing and complex environments. It helps businesses determine the best project management approach.

- Volatility:  Rate of change and disruption in a business or situation.
- Uncertainty: Lack of predictability and potential for surprises.
- Complexity: High number of interrelated forces and factors.
- Ambiguity: Risk of misunderstanding conditions and root causes.

Agile is highly effective in high VUCA environments, allowing organizations to stay responsive and innovative in the face of uncertainty and change.
