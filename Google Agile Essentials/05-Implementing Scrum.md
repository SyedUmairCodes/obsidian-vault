# Implementing Scrum

The product backlog is the  single authoritative source for team tasks and deliverables. Tasks and items can be added anytime by the product owner who can also prioritize which tasks should be completed first.

User stories are short and simple descriptions of the product and it's features from the user's perspective. User stories must be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable.

Each user story completion can be estimated using relative estimation such as t-shirt sizes and story points.

> Use T-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL) for quick estimates while story points use the Fibonacci sequence for more precise estimates.

A scrum sprint is a time-period in which the selected tasks must be completed. Each day the team has a 15-minute meeting to update everyone on their individual progress and get feedback.
