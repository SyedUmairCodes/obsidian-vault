# Introduction to Microsoft Azure

Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform that offers users compute, networking, and storage resources on a pay-per-use payment model meaning users only pay for what they they use.

When you sign up for Azure, you'll be greeted with an online portal that'll allow you to easily manage and create new resources for yourself.

The most common services include:

- Virtual Machines.
- AI Services.
- Kubernetes and Containers.
- App Deployments.
- Storage.
- SQL Databases.

The portal also gives users access to each service's documentation, Microsoft defender for security, a cost manager, a monitor for your deployed services.
