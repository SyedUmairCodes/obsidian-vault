# Containers

Containers package applications and their dependencies into isolated, portable units for consistent deployment across different environments. The key analogy is a "to-go coffee kit" containing everything needed to make your coffee taste the same, regardless of location. This solves the common "works on my machine" problem.

**Benefits of Containers:**

- **Lightweight:** Containers share the host OS kernel, making them smaller and faster than VMs. They consume fewer resources.
- **Portable:** "Build once, run anywhere." Consistent execution across different environments (development, testing, production).
- **Reliable:** Eliminates dependency conflicts and ensures predictable application behavior.

**The Challenge of Container Management:**

- **Infrastructure Complexity:** Managing the underlying infrastructure for running containers (servers, orchestration tools, maintenance) can be complex and time-consuming.

**Introducing Azure Container Instances (ACI):**

- **Simplified Container Deployment:** ACI allows running containers directly in Azure without managing VMs or complex orchestration tools.
- **Fast and Easy:** Quick provisioning and deployment of containers within seconds using the Azure portal.

**Monitoring with Azure Alerts:**

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Azure Alerts provide immediate notifications of performance issues or specific events.
- **Customizable Rules:** Define alerts based on various metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, response time, etc.).
- **Automated Actions:** Trigger actions like scaling up resources or sending notifications based on alerts.

**Setting up an Alert:**

- **Define the Condition:** Specify the metric and threshold for triggering the alert (e.g., CPU usage > 80%).
- **Choose an Action:** Select the desired action: email notification, Teams message, or triggering a Logic App.
