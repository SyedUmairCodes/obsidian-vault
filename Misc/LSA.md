# Luck surface area

The idea is that by doing more of the things that have the potential to lead to opportunity, you can improve your luck.

The result? The lucky people seized the opportunity and found more success in the task.

The unlucky people approached the task more carefully, explored less, and viewed opportunities that were put in front of them with skepticism. This resulted in the unlucky group reaping fewer rewards in the study than their lucky peers.

What set apart the “lucky” individuals in Wiseman’s study was not natural phenomenon, or chance. Rather, it was their willingness to approach situations with a positive, open-minded attitude.

Per Richardson’s research, these individuals exhibited similar characteristics in their daily lives:

- Take alternate routes to and from work so they have the chance to meet new people and see new things.
- Being intentional about practicing socializing in different group settings, like parties and gatherings.
- Being resilient, adaptive, maintaining a positive outlook, and moving past negative circumstances.

These habits demonstrate an effort to increase their “luck surface area.” In other words, they play a numbers game. The more often they put themselves out there with the opportunity for good things to happen, the more often good things will happen.

As an introvert who is admittedly set in his routine, reading this was eye-opening for me.

You can’t meet new people, have new experiences, or come across new opportunities by doing the same things you always do.

**So if anyone else is looking to increase their luck surface area, too, here are tangible habits you can build to increase your luck:**

1. Shake up Your Routine and Try New Things
2. Build a Content Creation Habit
3. Meet New People in Real-Life and Online

Let’s jump into how you can apply each of these strategies.

## 1. Shake Up Your Routine and Try New Things

_Key takeaway: Be intentional about changing your schedule and usual habits in order to meet new people and expose yourself to the opportunities that arise from new connections._

You might have heard the philosophy that when you first move to a new city you should say “yes” to everything for a few months.

The idea is a temporary “yes” mentality will help you discover enough new things and new people to set up your life in your new city.

Did you get invited to a happy hour by new co-workers? Go check it out. Were you recommended a new workout class? Grab your gym clothes.

Exploring these new settings, hobbies, and social circles will massively increase your luck surface area, and in turn, expose you to new opportunities.

This same network effect concept applies to your current town or city. Stop going to the same coffee shop every day, eating at the same restaurants, walking the same routes, etc. It decreases your chances of making new connections. You never know how those connections could bring you some “luck.”

### Action Items:

1. Identify areas in your routine where you have the opportunity to make relatively small adjustments that have the potential for outsized returns. For example, if you work in coffee shops, choose 10 new coffee shops you will go to in the next 2 weeks.
2. Make an effort to immerse yourself in these environments. Introduce yourself to the employees at the coffee shop or new gym, say hi to regulars, etc.
3. Do this for several weeks and reflect on what happened. Did you meet new people? Did you follow up on invitations to try new things?
4. Rinse and repeat with another aspect of your routine.

## 2. Build a Content Creation Habit

_Key takeaway: Creating content online and building an audience increases your digital footprint. This can bring in new opportunities just like exposing yourself to new people and places in the physical world yields opportunities._

This idea comes from my experience building corporate brands, creating digital content, and designing lead-generation funnels. In the marketing world, the bigger the audience and digital footprint your brand has, the higher the likelihood you will generate business leads as customers discover your marketing channels and content.

The same thing applies to individuals and their personal brands. The content you create and your social media channels represent your digital footprint, or in the terms of this article, your digital luck surface area.

### Start Creating and Engaging

By creating content on social media platforms, engaging with other users' content, and making real connections, you can expose yourself to opportunities ranging from jobs and customers for your business to new friends.

In a world where we spend so much time online, your digital presence and footprint can be just as lucrative as your footprint in the physical world.

### Action Items:

1. Choose a marketing channel like LinkedIn or TikTok based on your content creation skills and target audience. If you enjoy writing and have a professional audience in mind, LinkedIn is great. If targeting a younger consumer audience and creating video content is a better fit for you, TikTok is a good choice.
2. Set mini goals for the amount of content you create each week, the number of comments you leave on other people’s posts, and the number of direct messages you respond to.
3. Do this for 1–2 months and reflect on your results.

## 3. Meet New People in Real Life and Online

_Key takeaway: Remember that making connections professionally and personally is a numbers game. In both cases, always prioritize depth and substance over quantity._

This next tip is a lens you can apply while considering the previous two tips.

As you change your routine and create content online, you should do so with the mentality that you are giving yourself the opportunity to make meaningful connections. To do so, you need to have a lot of “first dates.”

I read another insightful Twitter thread (I’ll admit I misplaced the bookmark) in which a user shared her online dating journey. To increase her chances of success, she approached dating like a business lead generation funnel — as a marketing professional I obviously found it to be amusing and intriguing.

Her strategy was:

1. Get as many dating apps matches as she could.
2. Start conversations with all of those matches and progress engaging conversations to a first date.
3. Progress good first dates to second and third dates.
4. Eventually, she found her ideal partner out of the short list of candidates who made it through her dating lead generation funnel.

By playing the luck surface area strategy, she gave herself tons of opportunities to meet new people. This increased the likelihood of her finding a compatible partner. And it worked.

While it may be humorous, the philosophy behind business lead generation, professional network growth, and dating all share a common theme: the more connections you have, the greater your chances are of success. Image created by the author.

This idea doesn’t just apply to dating. The same concept works for networking and making friends, too.

The more people you meet and the more conversations you have, the higher the likelihood you build new relationships with people.

### Action Items:

1. As you try new things and go to new places (tip number 1 above), try to make as many initial connections as you can.
2. See which of those connections move on to the second stage. Connecting online, meeting for a coffee, etc. Basically, anything that gets past an initial conversation or two.
3. From there, see which relationships make it through this progressive “funnel,” and become valuable members of your professional network, or personal social circle.

## Concept

The concept of “luck surface area” was originated by management thinker and author Jim Collins, who used the term to describe the relationship between hard work and luck in achieving success. According to Collins, luck surface area is the amount of exposure an individual or organization has to opportunities and resources that can lead to success. The larger the luck surface area, the more opportunities and resources an individual or organization is exposed to, and the more likely they are to experience good luck.

Collins first introduced the concept of luck surface area in his book “Great by Choice,” where he argued that successful individuals and organizations are able to increase their luck surface area through hard work and persistence. He argued that these individuals and organizations are able to create their own luck through their actions and choices, rather than simply relying on good fortune.

Other terms that have been used to refer to the same concept include “opportunity surface area,” “opportunity horizon,” and “luck horizon.” These terms all describe the idea that individuals and organizations can increase their chances of success by increasing their exposure to opportunities and resources.

## Application

**Investing in skills and knowledge:** Collins argues that individuals and organizations can increase their luck surface area by investing in skills and knowledge that make them more valuable and attractive to potential opportunities. For example, an individual who is highly skilled in a particular area may be more likely to be offered interesting job opportunities or be selected for a promotion.

**Building strong relationships:** Collins emphasizes the importance of building strong relationships with others in increasing luck surface area. By developing a wide network of contacts and establishing strong connections with others, individuals and organizations can increase their exposure to new opportunities and resources.

**Pursuing new experiences and challenges:** Collins argues that individuals and organizations can increase their luck surface area by seeking out new experiences and challenges that expose them to new opportunities and resources. For example, an individual who is willing to take on new responsibilities or try new things may be more likely to be offered interesting opportunities or discover new resources.

**Being persistent and resilient:** Finally, Collins emphasizes the importance of persistence and resilience in increasing luck surface area. By being persistent and resilient in the face of setbacks and challenges, individuals and organizations can increase their exposure to new opportunities and resources over time.

Luck, by definition, is about chance, but it's not totally out of your control. So why not use this model to increase your chance of luck? 

**The _Surface Area of Luck_, or your chance of being lucky, is equivalent to the action you take towards your passion, multiplied by the number of people you effectively communicate your passion and activities to.**

**Put simply: Luck = (Passionate) Doing x (Effective) Telling.**

**START DOING, AMPLIFY WITH TELLING.**

In his original post outlining this simple and powerful idea, entrepreneur and coder Jason Roberts explained that taking action towards your passion will develop expertise in that area. Further, that _“when people become aware of your expertise, some percentage of them will take action to capture that value, but quite often it will be in a way you would never have predicted.”_

Roberts also pointed to the infectious nature of passion, and that taking action and sharing your passion will tend to attract others towards it, again amplified by the number of people who know about it. 

**EXPERIMENT AND TAKE RISKS.**

Tina Seelig, Stanford professor and the creator of Framestorming, has been studying entrepreneurs and luck for some time. Her reframing of how to view luck aligns well with this model. Seelig explains: _“Luck is rarely a lightning strike, isolated and dramatic. It’s much more like the wind, blowing constantly. Sometimes it’s calm, and sometimes it blows in gusts. And sometimes it comes from directions that you didn’t even imagine.”_

To better 'catch luck', Seelig encourages you to consistently take small risks that push your comfort zone. In doing this, explore the types of risks you’re willing to take, and identify where you might challenge yourself. For example, you might explore financial risk, investing money in something; intellectual risk, playing with a new idea and challenging your assumptions; or social risk, talking to someone new. 

Richard Wiseman, the author of the _Luck Factor_, agreed. His extensive research pointed to lucky people being the ones who were willing to continuously experiment and try new things. 

**THE CHALLENGE OF EFFECTIVE TELLING.** 

Obviously, 'effective telling' is not about pushing your passion onto anyone who dares come close to you. Rather, it involves _effective_ networking and communication.

This includes engaging with people from a place of care and generosity rather than focusing on selling or personal gain. It also means connecting with the right platforms and communities who might be interested in what you’re doing and are passionate about. 

**IN YOUR LATTICEWORK**

Use Ikigai or the Golden Circle to better align your ‘doing’ to your passion. The Golden Circle is particularly relevant when remaining open to unexpected opportunities that might look different from your plan but still address your underlying ‘why’.

In terms of developing expertise, use Deliberate Practice and Double Loop Learning to ensure that you improve your skills and mental models as efficiently as possible in your chosen area. 

The _Surface Area of Luck_ requires you to better network and communicate what you're doing, so consider using Cialdini’s Six Principles of Influence storytelling techniques such as the Hero’s Journey]and communications techniques such as Aristotle’s Rhetoric. 

Finally, in terms of understanding causal factors behind luck, you might want to consider Regression to the Mean and Probabilistic Thinking.

Actionable Takeaways

- **Pursue passionate work.** 
    

You don’t have to quit your job and sell the house to take action on what you’re passionate about. This might involve offering free services, volunteering, or side projects — it’s all about expanding your expertise and experience in your passion. 

- **Take small risks, regularly.** 
    

Part of doing more in your area of passion involves taking consistent small risks and experimenting. Push yourself out of your comfort zone to extend yourself and, as you do it, use Deliberate Practice and Double Loop Learning to learn more and deepen your expertise. 

- **Expect falls and setbacks.** 
    

Experiments will fail, some of your doing with seem to go nowhere. Consider what you can learn from it, how you can incorporate it into your broader story, and try again. It's all part of the process. 

- **Focus on building expertise and connections.** 
    

Rather than judging your movement by whether a project is successful, consider projects based on their ability to extend your expertise and network in your chosen area(s) of passion. 

- **Keep expanding your network.** 
    

Work hard to expand your network by making new connections and contributing to them in meaningful ways. Be open, be generous, and put yourself forward in an authentic way as you connect and contribute to others. 

- **Share your passion appropriately.** 
    

Be open to sharing the passion work that you are doing in ways that people might find interesting and useful. Ensure that your network knows what you are doing, what you care about, and what you’re capable of, without ‘selling’ in a crass sense. Think about how and when you tell your story through conversations, blog posts, social media, or anywhere. 

- **Be open to unexpected and unusual opportunities.** 
    

Much of the discussion around luck explores the tendency for lucky breaks to come in unexpected ways, from unexpected sources, and new opportunities taking you on unexpected paths forward. To ‘catch luck’, you’ll need to be open, flexible, and ready to take these opportunities, even when they don't align with your original plan.
