# The ORB Framework

The ORB framework helps marketers prioritize and balance their efforts across these three tiers when faced with overwhelming options like newsletter programs, SEO, PR stunts, and social media strategies.

- Owned media is the media you fully control.
- Rented media is on platform where you maintain presence but don't control the rules.
- Borrowed media is sponsoring other creators to promote your product to their audiences.

All marketing activities should guide audiences inward toward owned platforms. This creates a safety net against the volatility of rented platforms and ensures long-term audience relationships.

## Using the ORB Framework

Identify which owned platforms will serve as your foundation, select which rented platforms you'll use to engage and funnel audiences, determine which borrowed audience strategies will feed your wider marketing funnel.

Effective marketing strategies don't need to be complicated - a simple, well-structured approach focusing on progressive audience movement toward owned channels can be highly effective.

Blogs, email, and communities are owned platforms and are the most valuable channels for marketing. Social media platforms like X, Instagram and YouTube are rented channels where you can establish your presence but you can't control who sees your content. 

Placing an ad on a Podcast or sponsoring a video or post of other creators is borrowed content and is used for reaching out to a new type of audience.
