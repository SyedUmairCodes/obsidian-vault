# Machine Learning
Machine learning algorithms are trained with large sets of data and they learn from examples. They do not follow rules-based algorithms. Unsupervised Machine learning is what enables machines to solve problems on their own and make accurate predictions using the provided data.

Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making. Deep learning algorithms can label and categorize information and identify patterns.

It is what enables AI systems to continuously learn on the job and improve the quality and accuracy of results by determining whether decisions were correct. Machine learning has become a standard tool in many industries. A prime example of machine learning in action, used extensively for suggesting products or content to users.

Techniques like classification, clustering, and market basket analysis (identifying products frequently bought together) have been revolutionized by machine learning. Using machine learning to forecast future trends or outcomes, often challenging traditional statistical methods.

Software packages like R make machine learning accessible to a wider audience, emphasizing the importance of understanding the techniques rather than the underlying mathematics.

## Neural Networks
Artificial neural networks, often referred to simply as neural networks, take inspiration from biological neural networks, although they work quite a bit differently.

A neural network in AI is a collection of small computing units called neurons that take incoming data and learn to make decisions over time. Neural networks are a computer science approach to simulate how our brain functions, specifically focusing on neurons and their connections.

Neural networks are often layer-deep and are the reason deep learning algorithms become more efficient as the data sets increase in volume, as opposed to other machine learning algorithms that may plateau as data increases.

Data is fed into the network as input. This data is processed by multiple layers of artificial neurons (nodes). Each node performs calculations and passes information to the next layer. The final layer produces an output, which is the network's prediction or decision.

Deep learning is the evolution of neural networks. By introducing multiple layers and leveraging immense computational power, researchers were able to tackle far more complex problems than previously possible.

Facial recognition, speech recognition, and numerous other tasks are now achievable with high accuracy due to deep learning. Organizations like the NSA are investing heavily in neural network research.

## Batch Processing
Traditionally, data processing involved bringing data to a computer for analysis. However, with the advent of big data, this approach became inefficient due to the sheer volume of data involved.

Google pioneered a new approach where data is broken down into smaller pieces and distributed across multiple computers (a cluster). Each computer processes its assigned data piece independently using the same program. The results from each computer are then combined and further processed.

Google's innovation revolutionized how we handle massive datasets, becoming a cornerstone for many tech giants. Yahoo's adoption of this concept led to the development of Hadoop, an open-source framework that popularized the approach. Today, big data processing is a vast industry with numerous tools and applications built on these foundational principles.
