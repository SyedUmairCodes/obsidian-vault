# Digital Transformation
Cloud technology, Data Science, and Big Data gave rise to a lot of new companies and products that could be accessed by almost anyone but also made older businesses transform into digital businesses without the up-head costs of doing the whole process from scratch.

Small shops can have customers from around the world buy their products and news travels faster than an airplanes thanks to news companies adopting the cloud and making better predictions using data science on the big data that's available to them.

Digital transformation is not simply duplicating existing processes in digital form. It's the in-depth analysis of how the business operates helps organizations discover how to improve their processes and operations, and harness the benefits of integrating data science into their workflows.

Almost all industries have been digitally transformed by these technologies.

## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing allows data scientist's to rent powerful hardware for analyzing huge amounts of data and also store it and only pay a fraction of the cost that would be required if they had everything on-premise.

Data stored in the cloud can be accessed by your whole team, simultaneously and they can work in parallel on it which reduces the time needed for the analysis phase.

You can be working with the same data that your colleagues in say Germany and another team in India and another team in Ghana, they are collectively working together.

> Cloud computing enables you to get instant access to open source technologies like Apache Spark without the need to install and configure them locally.

## Big Data
Big data is massive quantities of data generated from just about everyday business operations. It requires computational intervention to be translated into actionable intelligence.

The data must be translated into actionable intelligence, using ethical, new and emerging technologies and methodologies. There are many sources of big data, such as the Internet of things, Web and mobile, APIs, social media platforms and MAWR.

> MAWR stands for "Machine-Assisted Workload Reduction". It is a concept that refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate tasks and reduce the workload of humans.

**Characteristics of Big Data**  
Big data is characterized by three main factors: volume, velocity, and variety.

- **Volume:** Big data refers to massive amounts of data, often measured in petabytes, terabytes, and gigabytes.
- **Velocity:** The speed at which data is generated and processed is known as velocity. Data can be processed in batches, periodically, near real-time, or real-time.
- **Variety:** Big data encompasses a wide range of data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

> Veracity is often considered a fourth V of big data. Veracity refers to the accuracy and reliability of data.

## Data Mining
Data mining involves using statistical analysis methods to find meaningful patterns in data. These patterns can be clusters, dependencies, or anomalies. Data mining processes can be automated to some extent, but it's important to remember that big data is a complex concept, and the term can be misleading.

Data mining is not about extracting data itself, but rather about extracting knowledge from large datasets. This knowledge can be used to improve business processes, make better decisions, and provide better customer service.

> Artificial intelligence and machine learning are often used in data mining to automate tasks and improve performance.
