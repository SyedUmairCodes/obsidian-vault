# Introduction to Data Science
Data Science is the process that is used to understand different things by observing them closely, each characteristic of the observable object is noted down as a variable and then we apply algorithms and techniques upon these variables to uncover the hidden details.

These details help you uncover the whole truth and is very valuable to companies that can use it to better improve their service or product.

> Data science is the study of data. Data is real, data has real properties, and we need to study them if we're going to work on it.

Data Science is mostly about data analysis and analyzing data isn't a new concept the only thing that is different nowadays is the amount and types of data that are being analyzed. The advancement in computing technology also plays an important role in this, we can quickly analyze huge amounts of data in a short time and apply the knowledge that we gain from the insights.

Data science can help organizations understand their environments, analyze existing issues, and reveal previously hidden opportunities.

> Organizations tend to focus on a single problem at a time and so we also need to find the exact problem that needs to be solved.

The first step in the data analysis process is to ask all of the shareholders about the problem and then collect the required data and analyze it to find the solution. Using multiple models to explore the data reveals patterns and outliers. Sometimes, this will confirm what the organization suspects, but sometimes it will be completely new knowledge.

When the answer is found, the Data Scientist becomes a story-teller that explains all of the process to the shareholders using data visualizations. Organizations leverage Data Science to help them solve any new problem that occurs or analyze previous data in order to improve their existing product or service that they provide to their customers.

> Companies like Uber, Target, and Amazon all use Data Science to improve upon their products and services to attract more customers and retain older ones.
