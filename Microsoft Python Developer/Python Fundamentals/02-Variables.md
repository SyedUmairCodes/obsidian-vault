# Variables in Python

Variables are like virtual sticky notes or labeled boxes that hold information within your code. They allow you to store data and give it a meaningful name, allowing you to access and modify it throughout your program.

- Replace cryptic values with descriptive names, making code easier to understand.
- Store a value once and reuse it multiple times, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability. 
- Adapt to changing conditions by allowing you to update the value stored in a variable.

## Creating and Using Variables

Assign a value to a variable using the equals sign (=). The value on the right side of the = is stored in the memory location associated with the variable name on the left. Change the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it. This is essential for reflecting changes in data or program state.

``` Python
employee_name = "Alice"
```

Use clear and meaningful variable names to improve code readability and understanding. This is crucial for collaboration and long-term maintainability. Add comments to explain the purpose of variables, especially for complex logic or less obvious variable names.
