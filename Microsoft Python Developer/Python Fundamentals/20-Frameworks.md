# Frameworks in Python

## Django
A high-level, "batteries-included" web framework. This means it provides most of the tools you need out of the box. Django encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It includes:

- An ORM for relational databases.
- Template engine.
- Built-in admin support.
- Security features.

## Flask

A microframework. It's lightweight and flexible, giving you more control over the structure of your application. Flask is ideal for smaller applications, microservices, and APIs. You choose the components you need, rather than being tied to a specific structure.
