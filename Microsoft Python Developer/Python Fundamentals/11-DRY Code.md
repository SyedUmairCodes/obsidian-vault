# Don't Repeat Yourself

Eliminate redundant code by consolidating repetitive instructions into reusable blocks (functions). Reduces errors, inconsistencies, and maintenance headaches. Achieved through the use of functions, encapsulating reusable logic.

Functions are the primary mechanism for implementing the DRY principle, turning reusable code into callable tools. The lecture emphasizes the synergistic relationship between DRY and functions.


## Benefits of Code Reusability

- **Scalability:** Easier to expand and modify code without disrupting the entire system.

- **Maintainability:** Simplifies updates and debugging by isolating changes to specific functions. Maintainability is emphasized as crucial for collaborative projects and long-term code health.

- **Teamwork:** Facilitates parallel development and efficient collaboration through modular, well-defined units of code.

- **Testing:** Enables unit testing of individual functions to ensure correctness and prevent unintended consequences. The importance of testability for maintaining code stability and reliability is emphasized.

- **Readability:** Improves code clarity and structure, making it easier to understand and navigate.
 
- **Debugging:** Isolates potential issues to specific functions, simplifying the debugging process.

## DRY Pitfalls

- **Over-Abstraction:** Excessive use of DRY can lead to overly complex and difficult-to-understand code.

- **Finding the Balance:** Consider factors like frequency of use, complexity, and likelihood of change when deciding whether to create a function.
