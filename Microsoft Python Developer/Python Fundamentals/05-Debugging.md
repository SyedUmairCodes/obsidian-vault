# Code Debugging

Debugging involves systematically following the execution path of a program to understand how it works and identify potential errors.  Precisely locating errors by pinpointing the problematic lines or functions. Deciphering how code works, especially when dealing with inherited or complex codebases. Gaining insights into code execution to identify areas for performance improvements.    

## Using the print statement

Inserting `print()` statements at strategic points in the code allows you to:

- **Inspect Variables:** Observe how variable values change over time.   
- **Track Execution Flow:** Verify the order in which functions are called.
- **Spot Hidden Errors:** Reveal unexpected results that might indicate bugs.
