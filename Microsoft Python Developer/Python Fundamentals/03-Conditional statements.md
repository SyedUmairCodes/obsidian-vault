# Conditional Statements

Evaluate conditions and execute different blocks of code based on whether the conditions are true or false.  Conditional statements act like checkpoints in code, directing the program flow based on specific criteria. This transforms static instructions into dynamic and responsive applications.

- If-statement checks a condition; if true, the code block within the if statement is executed. If false, the block is skipped.
- Else statement paired with an if statement, providing an alternative code block to execute if the if condition is false. 
- Elif Statement (else if) allows checking multiple conditions sequentially. If the if condition and preceding elif conditions are false, the next elif condition is evaluated.

```Python
x = 10
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("x is equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is less than 10")
```


## Importance of Conditional Statements

Enables programs to respond to user input, data changes, and external events. The lecture emphasizes that conditional statements are essential for creating dynamic and responsive programs.

Facilitates the creation of intricate decision trees for tasks like data validation, error handling, and implementing game logic. The examples provided (games, data validation, error handling) highlight the practical applications of decision-making in code.
