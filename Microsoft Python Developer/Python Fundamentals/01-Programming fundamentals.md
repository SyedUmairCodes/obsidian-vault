# Programming Fundamentals

Programming is fundamentally about instructing computers to perform tasks through a set of precise instructions written in a programming language (like Python). It involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps to develop solutions.

>Programming is pervasive in everyday life, powering everything from apps and websites to self-driving cars and medical equipment.

## Introduction to Python

Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s with a focus on readability and simplicity. The goal was to make a powerful yet accessible language. Python's syntax resembles plain English, making it easier to learn, write, and maintain, fostering collaboration among developers.

In Python, code is executed line by line, providing immediate feedback and facilitating rapid development and experimentation. This contrasts with compiled languages that require a separate compilation step before execution. 

Python abstracts away low-level complexities, allowing programmers to focus on problem-solving rather than intricate hardware details. This improves code readability and maintainability. It organizes code around objects (data structures containing data and functions), promoting reusability, modularity, and scalability.

> Python is used build web and desktop applications, used for data science and machine learning and even used in game development.

Unlike many other languages that use braces, Python uses indentation (spaces at the beginning of a line) to define code blocks. Proper indentation is crucial; misaligned indentation leads to errors. 

## Calculations in Python

Python leverages optimized libraries and algorithms for fast calculations, enabling efficient processing of large datasets and complex simulations. Eliminates human error inherent in manual calculations, ensuring consistent and precise results crucial for fields like finance and engineering.    

Automates repetitive calculations through scripting, freeing up time for analysis and decision-making.  Supports a wide range of numerical operations, from basic arithmetic to advanced mathematical functions, statistics, and symbolic computation.

- Basic arithmetic operations.
- Exponents and remaining values.
- Floor division.
