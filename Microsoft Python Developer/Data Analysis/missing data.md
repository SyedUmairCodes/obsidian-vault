## The Data Detective's Continued Investigation: Handling Missing Values, Duplicates, and Outliers with Pandas

We've established our role as Data Detectives, using Pandas as our toolkit to explore the scene (EDA). Now, the investigation deepens as we confront specific challenges commonly found in real-world data: missing information, repeated clues, and unusual suspects. Let's learn how to handle these effectively.

**1. Dealing with Missing Data: Filling the Gaps**

**(Analogy: Blank spaces in the puzzle, skipped survey questions)**

Data rarely arrives complete. Gaps (`NaN` - Not a Number, null values, blanks) are common and can wreak havoc:

*   **Causes:** Survey non-response, sensor malfunctions, data entry errors, issues when merging data, intentional removal for privacy.
*   **Impact:** Errors in calculations (averages, sums), biased results (if missingness isn't random), poor machine learning model performance.

**Finding Missing Data:**

*   **Obvious:** Blank cells, `NaN` values.
*   **Hidden:** Placeholder values (e.g., `999` for age, `-1` for counts), unusual categories ('Unknown', 'Other'). *Requires examining data (`.value_counts()`, `.unique()`) and metadata/data dictionaries.*
*   **Pandas Check:**
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np # Often used with Pandas

    # Sample Data with various missing value representations
    data = {'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
            'Age': [25, 30, np.nan, 35, 999, 40, 28, 32], # NaN and placeholder 999
            'Income': [50000, 60000, 75000, np.nan, 55000, 80000, 48000, 62000], # NaN
            'Gender': ['M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'Unknown', 'F', 'M'], # 'Unknown' category
            'SurveyResponse': ['Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'Yes', np.nan, 'No', 'Yes', 'No']} # NaN
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Replace placeholders with NaN first for consistent handling
    df.replace(999, np.nan, inplace=True)
    df.replace('Unknown', np.nan, inplace=True)

    print("Missing values per column (after replacing placeholders):")
    print(df.isnull().sum())
    ```

**Handling Missing Data (Context is KEY!):**

Consider:
*   *How much* data is missing? (A few rows vs. many)
*   Is the data missing *randomly*, or is there a pattern? (e.g., only low-income people skip the income question -> bias)
*   What's the *purpose* of the analysis? (Quick exploration vs. training a critical model)

**Common Techniques in Pandas:**

*   **Deletion (`dropna`)**: Remove rows or columns with missing values.
    *   **Pros:** Simple, removes problematic entries entirely.
    *   **Cons:** Can lose valuable data, can introduce bias if missingness isn't random. Best if only a *small* amount of data is missing randomly.
    ```python
    # Drop rows with ANY missing values
    df_dropped_rows = df.dropna()
    print(f"\nShape after dropping rows: {df_dropped_rows.shape}")

    # Drop columns with ANY missing values (use axis=1)
    # df_dropped_cols = df.dropna(axis=1)
    # print(f"\nShape after dropping columns: {df_dropped_cols.shape}")

    # Drop rows only if ALL values are missing (less common)
    # df.dropna(how='all')

    # Drop rows that don't have at least N non-NaN values
    # df.dropna(thresh=N)
    ```
*   **Imputation (`fillna`)**: Fill missing values with estimated or calculated values.
    *   **Pros:** Retains data size, can be more sophisticated than deletion.
    *   **Cons:** Fills are estimates, can reduce variance or distort relationships if not done carefully.
    *   **Common Methods:**
        *   **Mean/Median/Mode:** Replace `NaN` with the column's average (mean - sensitive to outliers), middle value (median - robust to outliers), or most frequent value (mode - good for categorical).
        ```python
        # Impute Age with Median (robust to potential outliers)
        median_age = df['Age'].median()
        df['Age_imputed'] = df['Age'].fillna(median_age)
        print("\nAge column after Median Imputation:")
        print(df[['Age', 'Age_imputed']].head(6))

        # Impute Gender with Mode (most frequent category)
        mode_gender = df['Gender'].mode()[0] # mode() returns a Series, take the first element
        df['Gender_imputed'] = df['Gender'].fillna(mode_gender)
        print("\nGender column after Mode Imputation:")
        print(df[['Gender', 'Gender_imputed']].head(7))
        ```
        *   **(Mention) More Advanced:** Regression imputation (predict missing value based on others), Multiple Imputation, using ML algorithms. These are beyond basic `fillna`.
*   **Create a Separate Category:** Treat `NaN` as its own meaningful category, especially for categorical data.
    ```python
    # Fill missing SurveyResponse with 'No_Response' category
    df['SurveyResponse_cat'] = df['SurveyResponse'].fillna('No_Response')
    print("\nSurveyResponse with explicit missing category:")
    print(df['SurveyResponse_cat'].value_counts())
    ```

**2. Tackling Duplicate Data: Removing the Echoes**

**(Analogy: Entering the same customer twice, counting the same thing twice)**

Duplicate data means identical rows or entries appearing more than once.

*   **Causes:** Data entry errors, merging data from multiple sources without de-duplication, system glitches.
*   **Impact:** Skewed counts and statistics (averages, sums), inaccurate reports, wasted storage space.

**Handling Duplicates in Pandas:**

*   **Identification (`duplicated`)**: Returns a boolean Series indicating which rows are duplicates (True) or unique (False). By default, it marks all occurrences *except the first* as duplicates.
    ```python
    print("\nCheck for duplicate rows (marks subsequent occurrences as True):")
    print(df.duplicated())

    print(f"\nNumber of duplicate rows: {df.duplicated().sum()}")

    # Show the actual duplicate rows
    duplicate_rows = df[df.duplicated(keep=False)] # keep=False marks ALL duplicates as True
    print("\nActual duplicate rows (if any):")
    print(duplicate_rows)
    ```
*   **Removal (`drop_duplicates`)**: Removes duplicate rows.
    ```python
    df_unique = df.drop_duplicates()
    print(f"\nShape after dropping duplicates (keeping first): {df_unique.shape}")

    # Customize which occurrence to keep:
    # df_keep_last = df.drop_duplicates(keep='last') # Keep the last occurrence
    # df_no_duplicates_at_all = df.drop_duplicates(keep=False) # Remove ALL rows that were duplicated

    # Specify columns to check for duplicates based on subset
    # df_unique_subset = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['ID', 'Date'])
    ```

**Preventing Future Duplicates:**

*   Improve data entry processes (training, standardized forms, validation checks).
*   Use unique identifiers (Customer IDs, Primary Keys) in databases.

**3. Managing Outliers: Dealing with the Extremes**

**(Analogy: The party crasher, the billionaire in the neighborhood income analysis)**

Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the dataset.

*   **Causes:** Measurement errors, data entry mistakes, genuine but rare/extreme events.
*   **Impact:** Skew statistical measures (especially mean, standard deviation), distort relationships, negatively affect some ML models, make visualizations harder to interpret.

**Detecting Outliers:**

*   **Statistical Summaries (`describe`)**: Look at min/max values and compare them to the quartiles (25%, 50% - median, 75%). Large differences can indicate outliers.
    ```python
    print("\nDescriptive Statistics (check min/max vs quartiles for Income):")
    print(df['Income'].describe())
    ```
*   **Statistical Methods:**
    *   **Z-Score:** Measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. A common rule of thumb flags points with a Z-score above 3 or below -3 as outliers. *Best for normally distributed data.*
    *   **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The range between the 1st quartile (Q1, 25th percentile) and 3rd quartile (Q3, 75th percentile). A common rule flags points below `Q1 - 1.5*IQR` or above `Q3 + 1.5*IQR` as outliers. *More robust to skewed data than Z-scores.*
        ```python
        Q1 = df['Income'].quantile(0.25)
        Q3 = df['Income'].quantile(0.75)
        IQR = Q3 - Q1
        lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
        upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

        print(f"\nIQR for Income: {IQR:.2f}")
        print(f"Lower Bound (IQR rule): {lower_bound:.2f}")
        print(f"Upper Bound (IQR rule): {upper_bound:.2f}")

        # Identify outliers based on IQR
        outliers_iqr = df[(df['Income'] < lower_bound) | (df['Income'] > upper_bound)]
        print("\nPotential Outliers based on Income IQR:")
        print(outliers_iqr)
        ```
*   **Visualization (Crucial!):**
    *   **Box Plots:** Visually show the median, quartiles, IQR, and explicitly plot points falling outside the IQR rule whiskers as individual dots (potential outliers).
    *   **Scatter Plots:** Can reveal points far away from the general cluster of data.

**Handling Outliers (Requires Judgment & Context!):**

*   **Investigate:** Is it an error or a genuine value? Domain knowledge is critical here.
*   **Trimming (Deletion):** Simply remove the outlier rows.
    *   **Pros:** Straightforward.
    *   **Cons:** Loses data, potentially valuable information if the outlier is genuine.
    ```python
    # Example: Removing the identified IQR outliers
    # df_trimmed = df[~((df['Income'] < lower_bound) | (df['Income'] > upper_bound))]
    print("\nTrimming: Remove rows identified as outliers.")
    ```
*   **Winsorizing (Capping):** Replace outliers with the nearest "acceptable" value (e.g., replace values above the 95th percentile with the 95th percentile value). Pandas' `clip()` can be used.
    *   **Pros:** Keeps the data point, reduces outlier influence.
    *   **Cons:** Modifies the original data.
    ```python
    # Example: Cap Income at the upper_bound identified by IQR
    df['Income_winsorized'] = df['Income'].clip(lower=lower_bound, upper=upper_bound)
    print("\nIncome after Winsorizing (clipping at IQR bounds):")
    print(df[['Income', 'Income_winsorized']].describe())
    ```
*   **Imputation:** Treat the outlier as missing data and impute it (e.g., with mean/median). Use cautiously, as it can significantly alter the data distribution.
*   **Transformation:** Apply mathematical functions (like log, square root) to reduce the skewness caused by outliers.
*   **Keep It:** If the outlier is genuine and important for the analysis, you might keep it and use robust statistical methods less sensitive to outliers.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Domain Knowledge:** Understand your data's context to judge if an outlier is an error or real.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Try analysis with and without outliers to see their impact.
*   **Goal:** The goal isn't always to *remove* outliers but to *understand* and *manage* their influence appropriately.
