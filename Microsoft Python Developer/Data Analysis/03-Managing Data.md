# Datasets

A dataset is compared to a collection of dots representing coffee shop customers, each with labels describing their characteristics (age, favorite drink, visit time).  This visual analogy makes the concept more concrete.

> The dataset is likened to a "giant spreadsheet," where each dot is a row and the labels are columns.  This connects the concept to a familiar structure.

By observing patterns in the data (e.g., many 20-somethings ordering iced coffee in the afternoon), we can discover trends and make informed decisions. Datasets can include large number of data points (thousands or millions of customers) and more variables (weather, loyalty card usage, reviews). 

Datasets can scale and encompass diverse information. More data can lead to richer insights for uncovering more complex relationships, such as the correlation between weather and drink choices or loyalty program membership and spending habits.

>Datasets are classified based on the type of data they contain. It can be text data, geo-spatial co-ordinates, or images and videos

## Data Quality

Data quality encompasses several key dimensions ensuring data is trustworthy and fit for purpose.  High-quality data is the foundation of reliable analysis. Not all data is created equal. Data quality and ethical handling are crucial for reliable analysis and responsible use.  This is a crucial point - data must be handled responsibly.

## Cleaning Data
Transforming raw data into a clean, structured, and usable format. Also known as data wrangling or data munging. Essential for accurate analysis, reliable models, and sound conclusions.  Clean data is the foundation of good analysis.

- Managing missing values by adding a default value or re-entering the data manually
- Removing outliers and capping extreme values.
- Correctly formatting all of the data in a single format.
