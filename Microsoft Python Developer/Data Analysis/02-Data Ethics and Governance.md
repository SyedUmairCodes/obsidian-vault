# Data Ethics and Governance

Data ethics are a set of principles and values guiding responsible data handling, going beyond legal requirements to prioritize individual and societal well-being. It's about making responsible choices, considering potential impacts, being fair and transparent, and protecting individual dignity.

- Obtaining informed consent for data collection and being transparent about data practices. 
- Implementing robust security measures (encryption, access controls, backups) to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access and breaches. 
- Actively working to identify and correct biases in algorithms to prevent unfair treatment and discrimination.
- Collecting only essential data.  The less sensitive data collected, the lower the risk.
 * Employing encryption and access controls to prevent unauthorized access.  Data must be stored securely.
 * Establishing clear agreements to protect privacy when sharing data with collaborators or third parties.
 * Removing or altering identifying information to protect individual privacy. This minimizes risks associated with data breaches.
 * Integrating privacy considerations throughout the entire data handling process, not as an afterthought.  Proactive planning for privacy is essential.
* Establishing policies and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and industry standards.
