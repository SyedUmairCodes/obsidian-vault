# AWS Cloud9
AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based development environment for cloud development. It enables development within the same environment where the code will run

One key advantage of Cloud9 is the ability to provision a virtual machine within AWS. Role-based permissions can be assigned to the virtual machine, enabling interaction with APIs and communication with other services without managing keys, enhancing security

Cloud9 seamlessly integrates with other services like AWS Lambda (serverless capability) and command-line tools.

Cloud9 offers advantages such as deep integration with AWS services and the ability to size your instance according to your needs, allowing you to test on powerful machines that you might not have access to locally.
