# Managing Projects
The best way to begin with project management is by crafting a quarterly schedule that outlines your weekly building goals. This practice fosters idea generation and provides a structured road-map for development.

Implement a routine of weekly demos within your company. This consistent cadence showcases progress, ensures accountability, and helps maintain momentum. If you're unable to conduct a weekly demo, it might indicate potential delays in meeting your deadline.
 
Investigate and incorporate DevOps methodologies, continuous delivery and automated testing. Continuous delivery ensures your code remains in a deployable state, mitigating last-minute setup complications.

Steer clear of processes that rely on individual heroism to meet deadlines. While individuals who go above and beyond can be valuable, dependence on such actions creates an unsustainable and potentially toxic work environment. Instead, foster a culture of predictability and consistent effort.

Embrace the Kaizen philosophy of continuous improvement, a concept rooted in the Japanese automobile industry. Strive for daily progress, constantly seeking ways to enhance speed, quality, and efficiency in your projects.

## Anti Patterns
Crisis-driven development is a method of development in which development only occurs as a reaction to a crisis. For example, imagine a situation in which a company only begins fixing bugs and addressing issues when they wake up at two in the morning to a broken system.

>This is not a sustainable way to run a company, and if this is a recurring problem, it is important to analyze what is causing the recurring crises.

Heavy Scrum, is a counter-intuitive anti-pattern in software development.It occurs when teams adopt the rituals and processes of Scrum without truly understanding the principles behind them. This often results in a focus on superficial aspects of Scrum, like meetings and burn-down charts, at the expense of actual productivity.

While trust in team members is important, it shouldn't come at the expense of a process that ensures accountability and continuous progress. Blind faith in individuals, especially when they promise deliverables without demonstrable progress, can be detrimental to a project.
