# Cloud Economics
Cloud economics is the study of how cloud computing can be used to save money and improve business agility.

- Elasticity means that a company can scale up or down its resources depending on demand. This is a significant advantage of cloud computing as it can save money and improve performance.
- Availability means that a website or service is always available to users. If a user sends a request, they should always get a response back.
- Self-service means that users can get the resources they need without having to go through a lengthy procurement process. Like a vending machine, users can get what they need on demand. 
- Cloud computing can reduce the complexity of running a business. Instead of worrying about security or network problems, companies can focus on solving business problems. 
- The total cost of owning and operating a system over its lifetime. With a physical data center, the initial cost is high, but the long-term cost can be very low. With cloud computing, the initial cost is lower, but the long-term cost can be higher. 
- Operational Resilience is the ability of a company to continue operating during a crisis. If a physical data center goes offline, a company could lose its entire operation. 
- Cloud computing can help companies to be more agile and responsive to change. Companies can focus on their core business and leverage cloud native resources.
