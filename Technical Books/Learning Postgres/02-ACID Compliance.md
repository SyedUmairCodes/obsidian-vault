# ACID Properties in PostgreSQL

ACID compliance is fundamental for applications requiring data accuracy and reliability, such as financial systems or e-commerce platforms. PostgreSQL's adherence to these principles makes it a trusted choice for mission-critical applications.

> All operations within a transaction are a single unit. Either all of them succeed or none of them.

Transactions maintain the database's integrity constraints, ensuring data validity and are isolated from each other, preventing interference and ensuring that each transaction sees a consistent view of the data. Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent and will survive even system failures.
