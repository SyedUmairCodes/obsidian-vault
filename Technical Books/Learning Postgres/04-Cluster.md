# The PostgreSQL Cluster

PostgreSQL, as an enterprise-level DBMS, is inherently complex. However, its solid design principles make it manageable once you grasp the fundamental concepts and terminology.

Managing a PostgreSQL cluster involves controlling the PostgreSQL *instance* (the running service) that manages multiple databases.  Key tasks include starting, stopping, monitoring, and controlling the instance.

PostgreSQL integrates with the operating system as a service. This allows you to manage the database using standard OS service management tools. PostgreSQL installations include OS-specific scripts and tools for managing the database service.
