# Introduction to PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is known for its stability and reliability. Think of it as the workhorse of databases â€“ it's built to handle critical tasks and consistently perform well. This is crucial for businesses and organizations that rely heavily on their data.

PostgreSQL can handle increasing amounts of data and user requests without significant performance degradation. This means it can grow with your needs, from a small project to a large enterprise application. In PostgreSQL, scaling can be achieved through techniques like read replicas and partitioning.

PostgreSQL has robust security features to protect your data from unauthorized access and modification. This includes granular access controls, encryption options, and regular security audits by the community.

>PostgreSQL offers a comprehensive set of features comparable to commercial database systems including features like JSON support, full-text search, and geospatial capabilities.

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group releases a new major version annually, typically in the last quarter of the year. This ensures a regular flow of new features, performance improvements, and security updates.

The sheer scale PostgreSQL can handle, billions of databases, tables, and terabytes of data. These numbers are astronomical and demonstrate that PostgreSQL is designed for even the most demanding data storage needs. However, these are theoretical limits. Practical limitations, like hardware resources (disk space, memory, CPU), will likely be reached before these theoretical limits.
