# Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level general purpose programming language used to build all kinds of websites and applications, having a major use-case in Artificial Intelligence.

Python code is written in UTF-8 formatted plain text files that end with the `.py` extension so that the code editor and the Python interpreter can understand which files are to be treated as Python source code files.

> The simplest program that you can write in any programming language including Python is to print the statement `Hello World!` on the screen or the console/command line of your computer.

In Python, you use the built-in `print()` function that comes with almost all version of Python version 3 and will print whatever you have written between the parenthesis of the print function to your console.

Code editors and IDEs like Visual Studio code and Jetbrains Pycharm are built with the functionality of syntax highlighting that means that each part of your code will be a different color if it's written correctly so that you can easily distinguish a variable from a function.

## Commenting code
Comments are used to add notes and provide context about the code that you have wrote. It can be extremely useful if you are working with a team or are working on a big project.

In Python, comments start with the `#` symbol and are ignored by the interpreter when the code is run. The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is supposed to do and how you are making it work.

## The Zen of Python
The Zen of Python are philosophical principles written by Tim Peters that the Python community follows when writing Python code. Following these principles makes your code pythonic.

> They are available in the official documentation and the IDLE editor that comes with default Python installs as well.
