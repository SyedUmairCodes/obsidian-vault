# Commenting Code

Adding well-placed and meaningful comments that describe what that piece of codes does is a great favor that you can do for your future self and the other developers that are going to read your
code. Good programmers should be disciplined enough to keep their comments as well as their code well maintained.

> Good documentation and meaningful comments don't make up for the bad code that you've written.

Comments are required for documentation and legal purposes as well. You'll need to define copyright and authorship statements that are necessary and reasonable things to put into a comment at the start of each source file.

> Comments can also act as warnings and warn people not to remove any core components so things don't break.
