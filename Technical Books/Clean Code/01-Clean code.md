# Clean Code

Clean code means that the code that you write is written in such a way that you can use it in the future and if any other developer reads or uses it they can easily understand the code as well.

> Code that isnâ€™t written clearly becomes a problem when you need to scale or use it again in a different environment.

If you keep writing spaghetti code, it will reach a point where the code base will be unmanageable and will be required to re-write the whole project from scratch. Learning to write clean code can only be done by learning the best practices of the programming language you're using and then implementing them in your code base until it becomes a habit

The major difference between clean and badly written code is that badly written code will try to do everything all at once while clean code only performs one function at a time.
