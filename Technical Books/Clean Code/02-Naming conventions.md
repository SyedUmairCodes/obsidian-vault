# Naming Conventions

Naming your functions and variables is a huge part of clean code. The name of the variable should explain what that variable was created for.  It should answer all the big questions, why it exists,  what it does,  and how it's used.

Don't include any noise words, keep the names easily pronounceable. If you have an error or are stuck somewhere in your code and you want help then easily pronounceable words will be better than gibberish.

Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase in them. Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like `postPayment` `deletePage` or `saveAccessors`.
