Okay, let's dive into this lesson transcript, which introduces SQL (Structured Query Language).

**Lesson Summary: Introduction to SQL and its Standards**

This lesson provides an initial background on SQL, the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It covers the language's history, its different types of statements, how it's used, and critically, the state of compliance with the official SQL standard among database vendors. It contrasts SQL standard compliance with the stricter compliance found in web standards like HTML5.

**Key Concepts Explained:**

1.  **What is SQL?**
    *   **Structured Query Language:** The standard language used for defining, manipulating, and controlling relational databases.
    *   **Evolution:** Started as SQUARE at IBM, evolved through SEQUEL and SEQUEL 2, eventually becoming SQL (often pronounced "sequel" due to its history, especially by older professionals). IBM was influential, but not the first to commercialize it.

2.  **Types of SQL Statements:** SQL is a comprehensive language covering three main areas:
    *   **Data Definition Language (DDL):** Used to create and modify database structures (objects). The main example given is `CREATE TABLE` (covered in Module 3).
    *   **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Used to retrieve and modify data *within* the database tables. Key statements are `SELECT` (for retrieving data - the focus of Modules 4 & 5), `INSERT` (add rows), `UPDATE` (modify rows), and `DELETE` (remove rows).
    *   **Data Control Language (DCL):** Used to manage permissions, security, and integrity (e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`). Often used by Database Administrators (DBAs).

3.  **Contexts for Using SQL:**
    *   **Standalone:** A user interacts directly with the database using a tool like SQL Developer, typing and executing SQL statements.
    *   **Embedded:** SQL statements are included within the code of an application program (written in languages like Java, Python, C#, VB.NET). The application sends SQL to the database, and the database returns results to the application.

4.  **SQL Standardization:**
    *   **Standards Bodies:** ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) have worked to create official SQL standards to bring order to the many early variants.
    *   **Goal:** To define a common language that different database systems (DBMS) can understand.

5.  **The Problem: Weak Conformance & Portability:**
    *   **Conformance Testing:** Unlike web standards (like HTML5, which has validation services and test suites like Acid3), there is **no active, independent conformance testing** for the SQL standard (NIST testing stopped in 1996).
    *   **Vendor Claims vs. Reality:** Vendors *claim* compliance, but often:
        *   Don't support some parts of the standard (even core parts).
        *   Add their own **proprietary (non-standard) extensions**.
    *   **Consequences:**
        *   **Reduced Portability:** SQL code written for one DBMS (e.g., Oracle) might not work correctly (or at all) on another DBMS (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL) without modification. Writing truly portable SQL is difficult for core features and often impossible for optional/advanced features.
        *   **Higher Switching Costs / Vendor Lock-in:** Because code isn't easily portable, it becomes more difficult and expensive for an organization to switch from one database vendor to another.
    *   **Vendor Argument:** Vendors might argue that this weak conformance allows them more freedom for innovation, even if it reduces portability.

6.  **Focus of Modules 4 & 5:** Mastering query formulation, primarily using the `SELECT` statement. This requires significant practice.

**Key Takeaways for You:**

*   SQL is the fundamental language for relational databases, covering definition (DDL), manipulation (DML), and control (DCL).
*   The `SELECT` statement is the workhorse for retrieving data and will be the main focus going forward.
*   **Crucially:** While there *is* an SQL standard, actual database systems (Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) **do not perfectly conform** to it. They have missing pieces and extra, proprietary features.
*   This lack of strict conformance means SQL code isn't always easily portable between different database systems. Be aware that you might need to adapt SQL code depending on the specific database you are using.
*   The pronunciation "sequel" comes from the language's history.
