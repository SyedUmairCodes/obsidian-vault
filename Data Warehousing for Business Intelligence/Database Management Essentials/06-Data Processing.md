# Data Processing
Parallel and distributed processing are two methods of utilizing multiple computing resources to improve performance and availability, but they differ significantly in their approach and goals.

 - Parallel database processing divides a large task into smaller tasks and distributes these among interconnected computers to improve performance.
 - Distributed processing involves the distribution of tasks and data among computers connected by a network. It focuses on enabling different sites to cooperate in providing access to data. 

Parallel processing focuses on performing a task faster and getting more work done in the same time while distributed processing provide local control of data, reduces communication costs by locating data closer to where itâ€™s used, and improve performance by allowing multiple sites to work concurrently.

## Architectures

**Common Parallel processing architectures:**

- Shared Disk (SD): Each processor has its own memory, but the processors share access to all disks.
- Shared Nothing (SN): Each processor has its own memory and disks. Data must be partitioned among the processors.
- Clustered Disk (CD): Processors in each cluster share all disks, but nothing is shared across clusters.
- Clustered Nothing (CN): Processors in each cluster share no resources, but each cluster can be manipulated to work in parallel.

A distributed database has a component architecture composed of local data managers (LDM) at each site, and a distributed data manager (DDM) that manages global requests. The schema architecture includes a global conceptual schema and local schemas for each site.
