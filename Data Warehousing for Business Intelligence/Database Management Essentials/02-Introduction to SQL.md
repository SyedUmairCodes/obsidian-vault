# Introduction to SQL

SQL or Structured Query Language, is an industry-standard language used for database definition, manipulation, and control. SQL is a non-procedural language that allows users to specify what data to access, rather than how to access it. SQL is designed to allow users to access data without needing to code complex procedures.

SQL is used to define tables, relationships among tables, integrity constraints, and authorization rights. The `CREATE TABLE` statement is an example of a database definition statement. SQL statements like `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,` and `DELETE` are used to manipulate data within a database. SQL has statements such as `GRANT` and `REVOKE` that are used to control access to data.

SQL is used to formulate queries, which are requests for data to answer a question. The `SELECT` statement is a primary tool for non-procedural database access. SQL can be used in stand-alone mode, where users submit SQL statements with a specialized editor, or in embedded mode, where SQL statements are included in a computer program.

SQL began as the SQUARE language in IBM's System R project, later becoming SEQUEL, and eventually SQL due to legal issues. SQL is a crucial tool for database professionals, especially power users and information systems professionals, as it enables efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
