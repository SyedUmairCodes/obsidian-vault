# Working with Databases

Different users interact with databases in various ways, depending on their roles and needs within an organization. 

- Functional users interact with databases as part of their daily tasks.  They either work with the reports generated from the database or are the ones who generate the reports.
- Power users: are the most active functional users, skilled enough to build their own reports and perform ad hoc queries.
- Information Systems Professionals interact with databases as part of developing and maintaining information systems. 

## Data and database admins

Database and Data administrators are both crucial roles in managing an organization's data resources, but they have different responsibilities and focus.

- Database admins work with individual databases and have both technical and non-technical responsibilities.
- Data admins have more broad responsibilities for information resource management.  They focus on handling data throughout the organization and setting standards on how data is used.
