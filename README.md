# Obsidian vault for 2025.

This repository is my obsidian vault for 2025. The notes in this repository can be viewed right here on GitHub or using any markdown editor like VSCode or Sublime but since I write them in my dedicated Obsidian configuration they look best in it.

> Currently most of the notes are not formatted correctly or are just walls of text due to me not having time to work on them.
## Themes and plugins

- Theme: Cupertino
- Plugins: I don't use any plugins, I even disable the built-in ones.
- Font: SF Pro Display and Dank Mono.

> I don't provide my `.obsidian` folder due to security reasons as many people on the subreddit have pointed out that the config folder comes with the extensions as well and can be used for hacking and illegal purposes.
